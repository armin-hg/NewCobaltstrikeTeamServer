1) Overview

NewCobaltstrikeTeamServer is a Go-based rewrite of the Cobalt Strike Team Server. It is a work in progress and serves as a learning project. The aim is to provide a clean, readable, and testable implementation that showcases Go patterns, solid module boundaries, and approachable code structure. The project is designed to be approachable for developers who want to study how a team server could be implemented in Go, with a focus on clarity over cleverness and on maintainability over micro-optimizations.

In short, this repository hosts a growing codebase that reimagines key server-side components of the Cobalt Strike ecosystem using Go. It is not a drop-in dropper for any real-world product; rather, it is a learning exercise, a place to experiment with networking, handshakes, protocol parsing, and modular design. The emphasis is on readable code, straightforward tests, and incremental improvements that anyone can follow and contribute to.

2) Why this project exists

- To explore how a complex server component can be expressed in Go while keeping the code approachable.
- To provide a learning platform for Go developers who want to study system design, network protocols, and modular architecture.
- To offer a baseline that others can extend, audit, and discuss without relying on a closed source reference.
- To encourage best practices in testing, documentation, and maintainable refactors.

3) Core ideas and goals

- Simplicity by design: clear module boundaries, small focused packages, and well-named types.
- Readable protocol handling: parsing and generating the necessary messages with explicit state machines and test coverage.
- Platform independence: emphasize cross-platform build and run, with portable Go code.
- Extensibility: easy to add new features, handlers, and configuration options without large rewrites.
- Community involvement: straightforward contribution paths, open issues, and clear guidelines.

4) Project status

The repository is actively developing. It focuses on essential server-side components, with an emphasis on learnability and correctness. The current state includes scaffolding for configuration, a basic networking loop, a starter protocol parser, and a testing scaffold. As work continues, additional modules will be fleshed out, tests expanded, and configuration options refined. The project welcomes feedback, questions, and contributions from the community.

5) Tech stack and design choices

- Language: Go (Golang) for readability, concurrency primitives, and straightforward packaging.
- Networking: standard library net package, with a clean separation between connection handling and protocol logic.
- Configuration: a simple, centralized configuration model that can be extended to support environment variables, config files, or command-line flags.
- Testing: Go’s testing package with table-driven tests to cover parsing, state transitions, and error handling.
- Modules: small, cohesive packages with clear interfaces to promote testability and ease of understanding.
- CI/CD: basic guidance and hooks for continuous integration; the exact pipeline can be adapted to your preferred CI provider.

6) How to think about the architecture

- Connection layer: handles sockets, I/O, and framing in a non-blocking style where possible, delegating protocol duties to dedicated components.
- Protocol layer: parses incoming messages, validates fields, and produces outgoing messages. It uses explicit state machines to make behavior predictable.
- Configuration and lifecycle: a central manager wires together components, handles startup/shutdown, and provides a simple debug/logging surface.
- Extensibility points: pluggable handlers for different message types, a pluggable storage strategy, and a hook system for future features.

7) Features you can expect or look forward to

- Lightweight, readable server skeleton that can be extended with more protocol features.
- A modular layout that makes it possible to experiment with different architectures without large rewrites.
- Clear tests for common success paths and error paths, aiding learning and future maintenance.
- A straightforward configuration model that can be adapted to multiple environments.

8) Getting started

If you want to explore the codebase, start by cloning the repository, installing Go, and building a local copy. The project is structured to help you navigate quickly from a high-level view to the smallest details.

- Prerequisites
  - Go 1.20+ (or newer)
  - Git
  - A working development environment for your OS

- Cloning the repo
  - git clone https://github.com/armin-hg/NewCobaltstrikeTeamServer.git
  - cd NewCobaltstrikeTeamServer

- Building from source
  - go mod download
  - go build ./...
  - The build process compiles all modules and yields a runnable binary in the project root or in the respective cmd directories, depending on how you structure the build.

- Running locally
  - You typically run the server binary with default configuration, then adjust via environment variables or a config file as you add features.
  - For example: ./NewCobaltstrikeTeamServer (this is a placeholder; the actual binary name will be produced by your build).

- Testing
  - go test ./...
  - The test suite covers protocol parsing, state transitions, and basic integration scenarios.

- Configuration basics
  - A config model exists to wire core components together. You can define port, host, logging level, and a few protocol-related knobs.
  - As the project evolves, more options will become available in a structured configuration file or environment-variable form.

9) Releases and downloads

The latest releases are published to the project’s Releases page. You can browse assets, check checksums, and download binaries or source archives as they become available. The releases page is the primary path for obtaining prebuilt artifacts. See the Releases hub here: https://github.com/armin-hg/NewCobaltstrikeTeamServer/releases.

- How to use releases: pick a suitable asset for your platform, download it, and follow the included instructions or a README file in the asset’s folder. If you prefer source builds, use go build ./... from the repository.

10) How to contribute

- Start with issues: look for beginner-friendly issues labeled Help Wanted or good first issue.
- Create a fork: make your changes in a feature branch to keep the main branch stable.
- Run tests locally: ensure your changes pass the existing test suite and consider adding tests for new features.
- Document changes: update or add documentation to explain new behavior, configuration options, and usage examples.
- Submit a pull request: provide a clear description of your changes, the motivation, and any trade-offs involved.
- Engage in discussion: code reviews are part of the process; be open to feedback and ready to adjust design choices.

11) Project structure and where to look

- cmd/ or cmd/server: entry point for building the server binary.
- internal/: core application logic, including server lifecycle, configuration, and routing.
- pkg/: reusable packages for protocol handling, logging, and utilities.
- internal/protocol/: definitions for messages, framing, and parsing logic.
- internal/handshake/: connection establishment and initial negotiation logic.
- internal/storage/: simple in-memory or pluggable storage abstractions (for learning).
- test/: test data, fixtures, and helper utilities for tests.
- docs/: lightweight documentation, design notes, and examples.

12) API design and protocol notes

- The project emphasizes clarity in the protocol layer. Expect explicit message types with small, well-defined payloads.
- Protocol handling uses a straightforward state machine approach. This makes it easier to reason about transitions and to add new message types later.
- Error handling is explicit and predictable: invalid messages produce clear errors and do not crash the server.
- Extensibility targets at the protocol boundary: adding a new message type typically involves:
  - Defining a new message struct
  - Implementing marshal/unmarshal logic
  - Wiring a handler in the protocol dispatcher

13) How to simulate scenarios locally

- Create a minimal client that can connect to the server, exchange a handshake, and send a few simple messages to observe the server’s behavior.
- Use logs to verify that the server receives messages, parses payloads correctly, and responds as expected.
- Extend the test suite with simulated client interactions to exercise various state transitions and error paths.

14) Security and safety notes for learners

- The project is a learning exercise and is not intended for production use. Treat it as an educational sandbox where you can experiment with Go patterns, network handling, and protocol parsing.
- Do not expose the repository to untrusted networks during development; keep experiments local or in a controlled environment.
- Use the releases page to obtain official artifacts for your learning environment, and avoid running unverified binaries.

15) Roadmap and future work

- Refine the configuration model with richer options and defaults that are easy to override.
- Implement a broader set of protocol messages and a more complete handshake flow.
- Add a lightweight persistence layer to demonstrate stateful behavior across restarts.
- Improve test coverage with integration tests that simulate realistic client-server interactions.
- Introduce a simple monitoring interface to observe runtime metrics and health checks.
- Enhance cross-platform support for building and running on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

16) Design philosophy and coding style

- Clarity first: code that explains itself through readable structure and descriptive names.
- Small, focused packages: each package has a single responsibility to reduce coupling.
- Explicit error handling: errors are surfaced with meaningful messages rather than being swallowed.
- Test-driven mindset: tests drive design decisions and help ensure long-term maintainability.
- Minimal dependencies: prefer standard library where possible to keep the project approachable for learners.
